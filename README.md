# Breakout game in SDL2

A simple yet fun game of Breakout implemented in C, using SDL2.

## How to build

This project requires the  [`SDL2`](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php),
[`SDL_image`](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/),
[`SDL_mixer`](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/) and
[`SDL_ttf`](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/) development libraries,
as well as a C compiler (such as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)).
The building process is greatly facilitated with the installation of
[`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).
